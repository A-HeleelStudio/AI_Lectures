One way HRM contributes to sustainability is through strategic workforce planning. This involves forecasting the organisation's future workforce needs and developing strategies to meet those needs. By aligning workforce planning with the organisation's strategic goals, HRM ensures that the organisation has the right people in the right roles at the right time. This not only enhances organisational performance but also contributes to long-term sustainability by ensuring that the organisation can adapt to changing business conditions. Another important aspect of HRM is talent management. This involves identifying, developing, and retaining high-potential employees who can drive organisational success. Talent management strategies may include succession planning, leadership development programmes, and mentoring initiatives. By investing in talent management, organisations can build a strong leadership pipeline and ensure that they have the skills and capabilities needed to achieve their strategic objectives. HRM also plays a critical role in fostering a positive organisational culture. Organisational culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, and behaviours that shape how employees interact and work together. A positive culture can enhance employee engagement, improve job satisfaction, and reduce turnover. HRM professionals are responsible for developing and implementing initiatives that promote a positive culture, such as employee recognition programmes, diversity and inclusion initiatives, and wellness programmes. In conclusion, HRM is a vital function that contributes to organisational success by strategically managing people. By understanding the role of HRM in creating sustainable organisational performance, recruiting and retaining talent, and navigating external and internal factors, you will be well-equipped to make a meaningful impact in your future HR roles. As we continue our exploration of HRM, I encourage you to think about how these concepts apply to your own experiences and aspirations. Remember, the principles and practices we discuss are not just theoretical concepts; they are practical tools that can be applied in real-world settings to enhance organisational performance and contribute to business success."

              "content_to_speak": "Now, let's explore the hard and soft models of HRM. Do you know what these terms mean? The hard model of HRM focuses on the quantitative, calculative, and business-strategic aspects of managing the workforce. It views employees as resources to be managed in a way that maximises organisational performance. On the other hand, the soft model of HRM emphasises the human side of HR, focusing on employee motivation, development, and well-being. It views employees as valuable assets whose growth and satisfaction are crucial for the company's success. Can you think of any real-life examples of companies that successfully implement these HRM models? For instance, Google is renowned for its soft HRM approach, prioritising employee satisfaction and development through innovative workplace practices. Conversely, companies in highly competitive industries may adopt a hard HRM approach to ensure efficiency and performance. In conclusion, understanding the various roles and responsibilities within HR, along with the skills required, is essential for anyone aspiring to enter this field. Strategic HRM plays a crucial role in aligning HR practices with business objectives, and the use of data analytics further enhances decision-making processes. By balancing the hard and soft models of HRM, companies can achieve both organisational efficiency and employee satisfaction."
